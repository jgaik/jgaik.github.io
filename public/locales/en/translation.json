    "introduction": "I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on front-end development, backed by a foundation in back-end programming. My journey into coding began with a passion for creating tools that automate and improve daily tasks. I enjoy the freedom that programming offers, where design and implementation possibilities are virtually limitless.\nBeyond work, I’m passionate about personal growth. I enjoy calisthenics, acrobatics, and learning Japanese, as well as experimenting in the kitchen. My approach to life is rooted in organization and simplicity: breaking tasks into manageable chunks and prioritizing not over-complicated solutions. I focus on completing 80% of a task quickly to achieve the result fast and then refine it over time.",
