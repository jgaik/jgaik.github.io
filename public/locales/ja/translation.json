    "introduction": "I’m a software engineer with a strong focus on front-end development, backed by a foundation in back-end programming. My journey into coding began with a passion for creating tools that automate and improve daily tasks. I enjoy the freedom that programming offers, where design and implementation possibilities are virtually limitless.<br />One of my key strengths is the ability to quickly analyze code, identify inefficiencies, and refactor it to align with the intended goals. Whether it’s last-minute bug fixes or quick pivots under time pressure, I thrive on delivering quality solutions.<br />Beyond work, I’m passionate about personal growth. I enjoy calisthenics, acrobatics, and learning Japanese, as well as experimenting in the kitchen. My approach to life is rooted in organization: breaking tasks into manageable chunks and prioritizing for efficiency. Following the 80:20 principle, I focus on completing 80% of a task quickly to achieve the best result and refine it over time.",
